# Apex for Salesforce Professionals 
This brief course trains non-developers—Solution Architects, Project Managers, Business Analysts, and Admins—to become Apex-literate. 

Learners are not expected to write production-grade code. Instead, the course focuses on helping them understand Apex, recognize when it’s needed and highlight the structure of the clean code. Demonstrate how simple declarative changes can break poorly designed Apex.

## Learning Path 
1. [Intro to Apex](modules/intro-to-apex.md) — Understand why Apex exists, how it complements declarative tools, and explore the platform runtime before attempting larger projects.
2. [Governor Limits](modules/governor-limits.md) — Diagnose and design around transactional limits so automations remain reliable under enterprise load.
3. [Declarative vs Programmatic Tools](modules/declarative-vs-programmatic.md) — Build a repeatable decision model for when Flow, approvals, or Apex should own a requirement, and learn how to brief developers with risk-aware context.
4. [Apex Data Types](modules/apex-data-types.md) — Master scalar types, `Id`/date handling, and the differences between strong typing on `sObject` records versus the dynamic `sObject` base class.
5. [Apex Control Flow structures](modules/apex-control-flow-structures.md) — Interpret branching and looping structures so you can predict how triggers behave before changing requirements.
6. [Apex Collections](modules/apex-collections.md) — Learn when to choose Lists, Sets, or Maps, and practice bulk-safe DML/SOQL patterns that scale beyond single-record thinking.
